## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

### Major Learnings

A key takeaway from this project was learning how to use flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts.


Here is a code snippet highlighting how I used flexbox:


```css
/* Adjustments for mobile screens */
.perfil {
  background-color: white;
  font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  font-weight: bold;
  width: 150px;
  height: 210px;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 2px;

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

```

### Continued development

In future projects, I will continue to focus on learning how to organize HTML elements and improve responsive design. This includes honing my skills in positioning elements effectively and ensuring that layouts adapt smoothly to various screen sizes. Mastering these skills will contribute to creating more polished and user-friendly designs.
